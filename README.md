d3 bookmarklet
==============

The d3 bookmarklet loads [d3.js](http://d3js.org) on any web page so that you
can crack open your browser's JavaScript console and easily extract data from
web pages.

GitHub doesn't seem to like `javascript:` links, but you can grab the
bookmarket from [this page](http://prag.ma/code/d3-bookmarklet/).
