# D3 bookmarklet

The D3 bookmarklet loads [d3.js](http://d3js.org) on any web page[\*](#note)
so that you can crack open your browser's JavaScript console and run "queries"
with D3's awesome, declarative API.

GitHub doesn't seem to like `javascript:` links, but you can grab the
bookmarket from [this page](http://prag.ma/code/d3-bookmarklet/).

#### Note
**Sites that employ cross-domain JavaScript restrictions will prevent this
bookmarklet from loading D3.** If you _really_ need this, you'll probably want
to build a bookmarklet that just inlines whichever parts of D3 you need. That's
left as an exercise for the reader.
